# Assignment 01

**TODO List**

**Due Date: Week 7 - Midnight of 3/8/2017**

## How It Works?

* The TODO list consists of 3 sections: (1)Add Item (2)TODO (3)Completed.
* The Add Item section contains the form input used to create the list items.
* The Created list items go into the TODO section.
* Each List item generated contains a checkbox, the list item and the edit and delete buttons.
* When the box is checked (indicating the completion of the task), the item moves to the Completed Section. 
* Similarly, when the box is unchecked, it moves back to the TODO section.
